## Overview 
DOME is the Distributed Object-based Modeling Environment. It's purpose and goal was to provide a standard way to develop analytical models with causal relationships. The DOME client facilitates this, and provides a standard way to wrap and link in models in other languages or tools such as Python or Excel.

The toolkit also allows one to build so-called "integrated" models where multiple existing models can have their inputs and outputs mapped to a causal chain.

DOME also provides a mechanism for runnning these models in a standard way.

DOME was originally developed by MIT under a variety of funding sources in the 1990s. In 2011/2012, General Electric evolved the capability under funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 

## Getting DOME

## Building DOME 
DOME is built using Ant.

To build the DOME client, execute the command:
*ant dist-client*

To build the DOME server, execute the command:
`ant dist-server`

To build the DOME war file, execute the command:
`ant dist-war`

The artifacts created by Ant can be removed by executing the command:
`ant clean`

## Running DOME 
DOME can also be run, after it is built, using Ant.

To run the DOME client, execute the command:
`ant run-client`

To run the DOME server, execute the command:
`ant run-server`
