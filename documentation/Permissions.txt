Permission Implementation in DOME

The following macros are referred to in this document:

MODEL_MODIFY_PRIVILEGES = "Modify model or iProject";
MODEL_COPY_PRIVILEGES = "Copy model or iProject";
PLAYSPACE_MODIFY_PRIVILEGES = "Modify playspace";
PLAYSPACE_COPY_PRIVILEGES = "Copy playspace";
PLAYSPACE_CHANGE_PRIVILEGES = "Change values";
PERMISSION_TO_VIEW_INTERFACE ="View and run in a new playspace";
PERMISSION_TO_SUBSCRIBE_TO_INTERFACE = "Subscribe to interface";

The permission constraints explained below do not apply to the administrator, as the administrator has permission to execute all operations.

The OBJECT_PERMISSIONS table has three columns 'OBJET_ID', 'USER_ID' and 'PERMISSION_ID'.

A user can see an interface if one or more of these conditions is satisfied:  1. user has PERMISSION_ID =PERMISSION_TO_VIEW_INTERFACE for that interface
					       			            2. user belongs to a group that has PERMISSION_ID = PERMISSION_TO_VIEW_INTERFACE  for that interface


A user can see the model if one or more of these conditions is satisfied: 1. the model has one or more interfaces that the user can see.
								         2. the model has one or more interfaces that a group, that the user belongs to, can see

A user can see a playspace if one or more of these conditions is satisfied: 1. user has PERMISSION_ID =PLAYSPACE_CHANGE_PRIVILEGES for that playspace
					       			            2. user belongs to a group that has  PERMISSION_ID =PLAYSPACE_CHANGE_PRIVILEGES for that playspace

When checking out a model the model_name.dml file is saved to local directory. If specific permissions are satisfied the interfaces of the model are saved, as well as the *.dvc file, which contains the version information.

A user can checkout a model if one or more of these conditions is satisfied: 1. user has PERMISSION_ID = MODEL_COPY_PRIVILEGES for that model
					       			              2. user belongs to a group that has PERMISSION_ID = MODEL_COPY_PRIVILEGES for that model

During checkout the version information (*.dvc file) is saved if one or more of these conditions is satisfied: 1. user has PERMISSION_ID = MODEL_MODIFY_PRIVILEGES for that model
									       			        2. user belongs to a group that has 	PERMISSION_ID = MODEL_MODIFY_PRIVILEGES for that model

Note: when checking out a model, only the interfaces that the user can see (see notes above on when a user can see an interface) are checked-out.


When checking out a playspace the playspace_name.dps file is saved to local directory. If specific permissions are satisfied the *.dvc file, which contains the version information, is also saved.

A user can checkout a playspace if one or more of these conditions is satisfied: 1. user has PERMISSION_ID = PLAYSPACE_COPY_PRIVILEGES for that playspace
				 	       			                    2. user belongs to a group that has PERMISSION_ID = PLAYSPACE_COPY_PRIVILEGES for that playspace

During checkout the version information (*.dvc file) is saved if one or more of these conditions is satisfied: 1. user has PERMISSION_ID =  PLAYSPACE_MODIFY_PRIVILEGES for that playspace
									       			        2. user belongs to a group that has 	PERMISSION_ID = PLAYSPACE_MODIFY_PRIVILEGES for
													that playspace

A user can see an interface, in the Model subscriber browser, if one or more of these conditions is satisfied:  1. user has PERMISSION_ID =PERMISSION_TO_SUBSCRIBE_TO_INTERFACE for that interface
					       			            2. user belongs to a group that has PERMISSION_ID = PERMISSION_TO_SUBSCRIBE_TO_INTERFACE  for that interface


Note:'guest' is treated as a group. In addition to the permissions that the user has, the user also has all the permissions that the 'guest' has.
